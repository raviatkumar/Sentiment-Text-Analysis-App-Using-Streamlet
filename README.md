# Sentiment-Text-Analysis-App-Using-Streamlet

With the help of the streamlit app, we created a web app to predict the emotions of the text that is used as input for the emotion classifier model (Logistic Regression). 

The trained model was pickled into a.pkl file and exported to the web app using a pipeline we constructed using the CountVectorizer and LogisticRegression modules.
